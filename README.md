## Project Purpose
The primary objective of this project is to enhance and demonstrate my skills in working with APIs by developing a web application that fetches and displays data from multiple APIs. This project serves as a practical application to showcase my proficiency in using `async/await` and `fetch` for API requests. The application utilizes three different APIs to provide location-based information to the user.

## Outcome






## Technologies Used

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Used for structuring the content and layout of the application.
- **CSS**: Employed for styling and enhancing the visual aspects of the app.
- **Bootstrap**: Integrated for responsive design and card components.
- **JavaScript**: Implemented for handling API requests and displaying data using `async/await` and `fetch`. Key JavaScript features include:
  - Fetching data from APIs
  - Using `async/await` for asynchronous operations
  - Handling errors and displaying error messages to the user
  - Using `navigator.geolocation` API to get user's location
- - **Geocode.xyz API**: [Geocode.xyz API](https://geocode.xyz/api)
- **REST Countries API**: [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/)

## At the end of the project, will be able to;

This project has significantly contributed to my understanding and mastery of working with APIs in JavaScript. By developing this application, I have gained practical experience in making asynchronous API requests, handling geolocation data, and dynamically updating the DOM with the fetched data. Additionally, I have improved my ability to handle errors and provide feedback to users.
